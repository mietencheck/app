    "Häufig gestellte": "Frequently asked",
    "Fragen": "questions",
    "FAQ 1 Frage": "What is the Rent Control Act?",
    "FAQ 1 Antwort": "The Rent Control Act is a law designed to slow down the rapid rise in rents. On the one hand, the rent freeze is intended to prevent new rental agreements being concluded with excessively high rents and, on the other, to enable excessively high rents to be reduced.",
    "FAQ 2 Frage": "What are the benefits of the Rent Control Act?",
    "FAQ 2 Antwort": "If you successfully apply the rent freeze, you will have to pay significantly less rent in future and can reclaim the rent you have paid in excess. In addition, if many people successfully reduce their rent, the rent index will also be kept low. This is important because the rent index is the benchmark for permissible rent levels. ",
    "FAQ 3 Frage": "Does the Rent Control apply throughout Berlin?",
    "FAQ 3 Antwort": "The Rent Control Act has been applied throughout Berlin since 2015, because rents are rising very quickly everywhere and affordable housing is hard to find. All legal criteria for determining a “tight housing market” are met throughout Berlin.",
    "FAQ 4 Frage": "Does the Rent Control apply to all apartments?",
    "FAQ 4 Antwort": "Unfortunately no, there are a few exceptions. Use our calculator to find out whether you can apply the Rent Control! ",
    "FAQ 5 Frage": "How high can the permitted rent be?",
    "FAQ 5 Antwort": "The permissible rent is based on the local comparative rent. In Berlin, this is usually determined according to the rent index. There are also other factors that can influence the permissible rent. In particular, modernization measures carried out can increase the permissible rent.",
    "FAQ 6 Frage": "What is the rent index?",
    "FAQ 6 Antwort": "The rent index shows how high the rent may be in the different areas of Berlin. To determine this, it is based on the average of existing rents in the respective areas.",
    "FAQ 7 Frage": "What do I do if my rent is too high?",
    "FAQ 7 Antwort": "Tenants must report a violation of the rent freeze. To do this, you should inform your landlord in writing of the determined permissible rent level. Your landlord must provide you with the information required to check the permissible rent level if you ask him/her to do so. You can find detailed information in our guide.",
    "FAQ 8 Frage": "Can I simply pay less rent after the complaint?",
    "FAQ 8 Antwort": "No, you should never do that! It cannot be ruled out that you have made a mistake in calculating the permissible rent or that a court has come to an unforeseeable legal conclusion. In this case, you could quickly fall into arrears. In the worst case scenario, this could lead to your landlord giving you notice to quit.",
    "FAQ 9 Frage": "Who are we?",
    "FAQ 9 Antwort": "We are the campaign to expropriate Deutsche Wohnen & Co. We want affordable housing for everyone. In our referendum in 2021, 59.1% of Berliners voted for the socialization of large housing companies. Since the Berlin Senate is blocking the implementation of the referendum, we are planning a legislative referendum. The implementation of a successful legislative referendum would be binding.",
    "FAQ 10 Frage": "Is it really free?",
    "FAQ 10 Antwort": "Yes, our calculator is really free",
    "FAQ 11 Frage": "Why are you doing this?",
    "FAQ 11 Antwort": "We want as many tenants as possible to use the rent cap. Because we want affordable housing for all Berliners.",
    "FAQ 12 Frage": "What happens to my data?",
    "FAQ 12 Antwort": "The answers to the individual features of the rent check or rent index are stored on our servers. However, no personal data is stored in this process. stored, in particular the storage takes place without the specified address data of the users.

    "Beratung durch Bezirke Text 2": "However, the districts do not offer legal representation in court. If your landlord refuses to reduce your rent, you can decide to assert your rights in court. To do this, you must hire a lawyer for a fee.",

    "Beratung durch Rechtsanwalt Text 3": "We have prepared a list of specialized lawyers for you, along with an overview of possible costs and information on legal aid.",
    "Beratung durch Drittanbieter Titel": "Paid advice from a third-party provider",
    "Beratung durch Drittanbieter Text 1": "You can also hire a commercial provider, such as Conny, to enforce the rent cap for you. The advantage of these commercial providers is that they bear the cost risk for you. If, for example, legal proceedings are initiated, the providers will bear the costs.",
    "Beratung durch Drittanbieter Text 2": "The disadvantage of these providers, however, is that they keep a portion of the money you save in the future. This portion is particularly high if you pay significantly too much rent.",
    "Beratung durch Drittanbieter Text 3": "There are also other things to consider with Conny: Conny does not accept all cases in which you pay too much rent. In some cases, it can take a very long time for Conny to process your case.",
    "Beratung durch Drittanbieter Text 4": "Important: Once you have commissioned Conny, you can no longer decide to take action on your own. Conny demands high compensation amounts if you want to withdraw from the contract at a later date.",
    "Wie kann ich mich für bezahlbare Mieten einsetzen?": "How can I advocate for affordable rents?",
    "Egal, ob du dich entscheidest, gegen deine zu hohe Miete vorzugehen oder nicht - du bist nicht alleine! Wir sind stärker, wenn wir uns zusammentun:": "Whether you decide to take action against your excessive rent or not - you are not alone! We are stronger when we join forces:",
    "Was uns motiviert": "What motivates us",
    "Motivation 1 Titel": "Why are we running a rent control campaign?",
    "Motivation 1 Text": "Deutsche Wohnen & Co enteignen is committed to affordable rents for everyone. The most important means of achieving this is the socialization of the large real estate companies. Until we have implemented the socialization, many tenants can reduce their rents with the rent control.",
    "Motivation 2 Titel": "The rent crisis is getting worse",
    "Motivation 2 Text": "Rents are increasing more and more. Politicians are doing nothing. This has fatal consequences for tenants: They have to spend an ever larger proportion of their income on rent. Some can no longer afford the rent in their district and have to move away. Many tenants hardly have any money left to live on. Meanwhile, landlords are profiting from the exploding rents.",
    "Motivation 3 Titel": "Landlords are demanding illegal rents - we are fighting back!",
    "Motivation 3 Text": "The rent demanded by landlords is often illegal - it violates the rent cap. Many tenants do not know that they can use the rent cap or the effort and costs seem too high to them. The regulations are often incomprehensible to many. We want to change that. We support tenants in defending themselves against the illegal practices of landlords. We draw attention to the legal options so that more people can exercise their rights and reduce their rent. We motivate tenants who hesitate not to be intimidated and to network. Numerous examples from the history of the tenants' movement show that those who join together win.",
    "Motivation 4 Titel": "When there are many of us, the corporations get angry",
    "Motivation 4 Text": "If we tenants use the rent cap, we can not only save ourselves a lot of money, we also ensure through the rent index that rents in our neighborhood do not rise so quickly. When there are really many of us, the big corporations get angry. We are putting a limit on your greed for profit. Imposing the rent cap is a sign against the rent madness in Berlin!",
    "Motivation 5 Titel": "The rent cap is not enough",
    "Motivation 5 Text 1": "Deutsche Wohnen & Co enteignen criticizes the rent cap as an insufficient means in the fight against the rent crisis. Even if we tenants impose the rent cap, the rents often still remain too high. The rents can then still be 10 percent above the local comparative rent. Many tenants cannot cope with that. Especially since illegal rents have been driving up the comparative rents for years via the rent index.",
    "Motivation 5 Text 2": "It is also problematic that landlords are not punished if they conclude rental agreements that violate the rent cap - even though this is illegal. This motivates landlords to sign rental contracts with rents that are too high and hope that tenants do not object. ",
    "Motivation 6 Titel": "The rent cap is full of loopholes and leaves tenants alone",
    "Motivation 6 Text 1": "The rent cap must also be activated by the tenants themselves. This presents them with a number of hurdles: Activating the rent cap can mean a financial outlay that not all tenants can afford. In addition, many tenants do not know that they can activate the rent cap and thus continue to live in overpriced apartments. Tenants also often fear harassment by their landlords if they exercise their right. We need regulations that reduce rents without tenants having to take action or fear negative consequences.",
    "Motivation 6 Text 2": "The rent cap has numerous loopholes: For example, it does not apply to newly built apartments, after extensive modernization, to furnished apartments, if the rental contract was signed before May 31, 2015, or if the previous rent was already too high.",
    "Motivation 7 Titel": "To put an end to the rent madness in Berlin, we need socialization",
    "Motivation 7 Text": "The rent cap can hardly do anything to counteract the rent madness. Effective means against ever-increasing rents are urgently needed. Many instruments that still offered tenants a certain degree of protection have been overturned in recent years. The implementation of the referendum on the socialization of large housing companies is therefore more necessary than ever."
